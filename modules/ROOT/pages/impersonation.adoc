= Run queries as a different user

You can execute a query under the security context of a different user through the parameter `impersonatedUser` in the request body, specifying the name of the user to impersonate.
For this to work, the user under which the request is sent needs to have the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/administration/access-control/dbms-administration#access-control-dbms-administration-impersonation[appropriate permissions].

When impersonating a user, the query is run within the complete security context of the impersonated user and not the authenticated user (i.e. home database, permissions, etc.).
