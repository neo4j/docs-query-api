= Query the database

To run a query on a database, submit a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

----
http://<host>:<port>/db/v2/query/<databaseName>
----

- `<host>` is where the Neo4j instance is located (example: `localhost`, `xxx.databases.neo4j.io`),
- `<port>` is the port on which the Neo4j HTTP server is set to listen on (optional; default `7474`),
- `<databaseName>` is the database you want to query (example: `neo4j`).

The server wraps the submitted Cypher query in a (implicit) <<transaction>> for you.
This means that in case any part of the query fails, the database will be reverted back to its status before any part of the query was executed.

It's not possible to control the lifecycle of transactions through the Query API.
If you need that flexibility, checkout the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/http-api/current[HTTP API] and  link:https://neo4j.com/docs/create-applications/[language libraries].

[TIP]
Each request must include an `Authorization` header, see xref:authentication-authorization.adoc[] for more information.

<1> Because the server does not know whether the request will be successful or not when it sends the HTTP status code, all API requests return a `202` status code, regardless of whether the statements were successfully executed.
The only exception is authentication errors, which result in a 301 status code.
<2> Query result keys.
<3> Query result values, in the same order as `fields`. +
For more information on what format the values may take, see xref:result-formats.adoc[].
<4> Entity ID within the database.
`elementId` should be used with care, as no guarantees are given about the mapping between ID values and elements outside the scope of a single transaction.
For example, using an `elementId` to `MATCH` an element across different transactions is risky.
<5> Bookmarks are used to enforce an ordering to transactions. +
For more information, see xref:bookmarks.adoc[].

[TIP]
====
**Literal line breaks are not allowed inside Cypher statements** submitted through the API (as per JSON specifications).
This means that queries should fit on a single line.
You can replace line breaks with spaces, as Cypher parses them equivalently.

== Query parameters

Avoid hardcoding parameters directly into queries. Instead, always use placeholders and specify the Cypher parameters within a `parameters` object in the body of the request.

The benefits of using query parameters are twofold:

- *Performance*: Neo4j compiles and caches query plans, but can only do so if the query structure is unchanged.
- *Security*: if using user input in queries, parameters protect against link:https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/protecting-against-cypher-injection/[Cypher injections].

.Good practice -- Use query parameters
[source, JSON]
----
{
  "statement": "MERGE (n:Person {name: $name, age: $age}) RETURN n",
  "parameters": {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 42
  }
}
----

.Bad practice -- Embed literals in query
[source, JSON]
----
{
  "statement": "MERGE (n:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 42}) RETURN n",
}
----
